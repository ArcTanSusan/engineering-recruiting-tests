# What is this

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and then I completed the exercise from https://github.com/parsleyhealth/engineering-recruiting-tests.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Features Implemented
* All the features are on 1-page. I did not have time to implement a carousel or multi-screen series of modals with a "Next" or "Back" button.
* You can enter demographic, medical conditions, answer short medical questions, and click Submit on the Terms and see a summary of results when you click the blue Submit button on any of the 4 sections.
* Clicking on the blue Submit button on the terms creates a fake API request in the console log. 
* You can search by the type or condition of the medical condition. The dropdown menu has 2 options: type or condition.
* No time for CSS styling or for unit tests.
